# HomeIPS
a simplified but powerfull Intrusion Prevention System for home users

Check out the Wiki for more information!

# Suggestions from Gerry Havinga, LinuXcien B.V. Leusden

## Please provide more information about:
  * Supported systems and architecture (e.g. Raspbian, Debian, RPi2, Ubuntu, i386 etc.)
  * Provide Wiki URL please!
  * Are the IP addresses really hardcoded, or are you planning to also publish: SetSnortConfig.sh
?
    * I suggest you create an initial setup/installation script to ask/determine initial parameters. 
	* Or even better let the system dynamically determin IP configuration
